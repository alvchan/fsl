-- THIS PART IS DONE BY fsl.sh (run "bash fsl.sh") --
// to get user account sonic
open wsl
sudo useradd -m -d /home/$username/ -s /bin/bash $username => makes user sonic
sudo passwd sonic => changes password for sonic
sudo chmod 666 /etc/wsl.conf => apply rw permission to everyone
echo "[user]" >> /etc/wsl.conf => sets field for wsl user settings
echo "default=sonic" >> /etc/wsl.conf => set user default on wsl to sonic
sudo chmod 644 /etc/wsl.conf => set permissions back to rw/r/r
close wsl and run "wsl --terminate <distroname>" => forces wsl to reread configs, <distroname> is probably Ubuntu
reopen and test

sudo apt install neofetch => gets a tool called neofetch from 'apt'
nano/vim/emacs/gedit ~/.sonic.txt
paste sonic ascii in with ctrl+v or ctrl+shift+v
